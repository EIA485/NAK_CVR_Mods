  "changelog": "- No longer requires AvatarMotionTweaker.\n- No longer piggybacks on IKSystem/PlayerSetup.\n- Tweaks to Locomotion & IKSolver weight blending.\n\n DesktopVRIK will now handle VRIK Locomotion weight instead of relying on CVR & AMT to handle it. This means LeapMotionExtension, PickupArmMovement, and CVRLimbGrabber will now work while in crouch/prone.",
