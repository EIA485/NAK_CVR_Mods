> Distracting and disorienting, taking its toll
>
> The player struggled, trying to focus and socialize
> But the path camera points just wouldn't let up, a never-ending surprise
>
> But then, at last, a glimmer of hope
> The player installed a mod, PathCamDisabler, with a single stroke
>
> The path camera points vanished, gone in a flash
> And the player breathed a sigh of relief, their struggles now past
>
> With camera control restored, the player socialized on
> Having a great time, their struggles now gone
>
> Thanks to PathCamDisabler, their troubles were through
> And the player could focus on the party, finally feeling brand new.
