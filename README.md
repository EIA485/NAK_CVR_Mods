# MenuScalePatch

just updates the menu position when the game detects a change in avatar scale

additional options to scale player collision & remove collider margin (skinWidth is pushing avatars off the floor by 0.08f)

To fully reach the floor, enable Scale Collision, No Skin Width, & Allow Small Player Collider in Experimental settings.

**Be aware**, as Allow Small Player Collider will allow the collider to reach below 0.3f, which will cause *harmless..?* console errors.
