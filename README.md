**CTRL+Z** to undo latest spawned prop. **CTRL+SHIFT+Z** to redo deleted prop. 

Includes optional SFX for prop spawn, undo, redo, warn, and deny, which can be disabled in settings.

You can replace the sfx in `"ChilloutVR\ChilloutVR_Data\StreamingAssets\Cohtml\UIResources\GameUI\mods\PropUndo\audio"`.
