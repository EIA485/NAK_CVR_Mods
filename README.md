# BadAnimatorFix
 A bad fix for a neiche issue. Is it really even a fix?

This mod occasionally rewinds animation states that have loop enabled.

Unity seems to have a weird quirk where animations with loop cause performance issues after running for a long long time.
You'll only start to notice this after a few hours to a few days of idling.

Disable loop on your 2-frame toggle clips! They cycle insanely fast and heavily contribute to this issue.
