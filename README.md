# MenuScalePatch

Originally forced menu position to update while scaling. Now changes ChilloutVR menu behavior to feel less clunky.

## Features:
* Menu position properly updates at end of update cycle.
  * This makes sure menu is always correctly positioned while moving and scaling.
  * This also allows for menus to be used while moving. (this is iffy though)

* Adds independent head moving support while on Desktop. (makes selecting users easier)
  * Hold ALT while on Desktop. Native feature that now works while in a menu.

* Implemented world anchors for menus. They can now be placed in the world, but still attached to you.
  * This is used for independent head movement internally, as well as a toggle for VR QM.

* Main Menu in VR is now attached to player rig.
  * Menu will now follow you while moving in world space, but not while moving in play space.
