# DesktopVRIK
Adds VRIK to Desktop ChilloutVR avatars. No longer will you be a liveless sliding statue~!

(adds the small feet stepping when looking around on Desktop)

Additional option to emulate VRChat-like hip movement if you like becoming a fish.

Control over disabling VRIK & LookAtIK during Emotes. (this can cause funky behavior)
