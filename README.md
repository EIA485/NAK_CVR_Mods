# FuckCohtml

This mod is designed specifically for ChilloutVR and its implementation of Cohtml. It is named to maintain consistency with my previous mod, FuckToes, and is not intended to be derogatory towards Cohtml or comment on its quality as a product.

This mod disables the CohtmlView components on the menus and forces them to render intermittently when closed. This helps to alleviate any hitching and performance issues that may arise, particularly with FPS drops while unmuted in online instances. This also helps prevent VRIK from constantly stepping in place while in VR.

## Examples

The following clips demonstrate the difference in performance with and without the FuckCohtml mod. While not a scientifically rigorous comparison, it is clear that there is a significant performance hit when unmuted, causing Dynamic Bones to jitter, in the clip without the mod:

However, with the FuckCohtml mod enabled, the performance hit when unmuted is almost negligible, as shown in the clip below:

While this mod is not directly fixing the performance hit while unmuted, it is likely freeing enough resources that unmuting does not cause a noticable performance hit while in online instances. This comes at the cost of Cohtml being a bit more fragile, as it is more likely to randomly error while disabled.
